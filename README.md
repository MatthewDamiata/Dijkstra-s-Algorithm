# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm Implementation
## CS240 - Fall 2019
### Team Project: Matthew Damiata, Benjamin Keurian

***

## Project Description

This program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and path distance between two planets in a graph. It also reads in data from a file and parses it into usable data to create Planet objects.
